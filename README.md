[Pocket](https://getpocket.com) facebook messenger bot built using [awslabs/chalice](https://github.com/awslabs/chalice), and runs on AWS Lambda and AWS API Gateway.
[Getpocket API](https://getpocket.com/developer/) is used to add URLs.

AWS S3 is used for persistence across runs, since this is serverless, state has to be maintained somewhere.

OAuth2 authentication is handled by the bot.

More details coming soon!
